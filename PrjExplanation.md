# 🚀 Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor

## 📋 Project Overview

**A modern, real-time collaborative coding platform that enables multiple developers to code together seamlessly, just like Google Docs but for programming!**

🌐 **Live Demo**: [https://collaboration-gwsu.onrender.com](https://collaboration-gwsu.onrender.com)

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

In today's remote work environment, developers often need to:
- **Collaborate on code in real-time** during pair programming sessions
- **Share code instantly** without complex setup processes
- **See who's working on what** in a shared coding environment
- **Join coding sessions quickly** with just a room ID

Our solution eliminates the friction of traditional code sharing methods!

## 🎮 How It Works - Step by Step

### **Step 1: Landing Page Experience**
1. **User visits the homepage** and sees a clean, intuitive interface
2. **Two options available**:
   - Create a new collaboration room (generates unique ID)
   - Join an existing room (enter room ID)
3. **Enter username** for identification in the room

### **Step 2: Room Creation & Joining**
1. **Click "Create New ID"** → System generates a unique UUID
2. **Enter username** and click "Join Now"
3. **Automatic navigation** to the collaborative editor

### **Step 3: Real-Time Collaboration**
1. **Monaco Editor loads** with VS Code-like interface
2. **Socket connection established** with the server
3. **User joins the room** and sees:
   - Live code editor
   - Sidebar with connected users
   - Real-time notifications

### **Step 4: Collaborative Features**
- **Type code** → Changes appear instantly for all users
- **See connected users** in the sidebar with avatars
- **Get notifications** when users join/leave
- **Copy room ID** to invite others
- **Leave room** when done

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Real-Time Communication Flow**

1. **Client connects** to Socket.io server
2. **Join room event** sent with roomId and username
3. **Server manages rooms** in memory with user lists and code state
4. **Code changes broadcast** to all room participants
5. **User management** handles join/leave events

### **Key Socket Events**

| Event | Purpose | Data Flow |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `joinRoom` | User joins collaboration | Client → Server → All Clients |
| `codeChange` | Code editor updates | Client → Server → Other Clients |
| `userJoined` | New user notification | Server → All Clients |
| `userLeft` | User disconnect notification | Server → All Clients |

### **State Management**

- **Frontend**: React hooks for local state
- **Backend**: In-memory room storage with user tracking
- **Real-time sync**: Socket.io ensures data consistency

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### **Production Build Process**
1. **Install dependencies** for both frontend and backend
2. **Build React app** for production
3. **Serve static files** from Express server
4. **Deploy to Render** with automatic builds

### **Environment Configuration**
- **Development**: Separate frontend/backend servers
- **Production**: Single server serving built React app
- **Environment variables** for configuration
